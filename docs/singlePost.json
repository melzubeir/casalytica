           "MarkdownDescription":"# What is DAODAO?\n\nDAODAO is the first platform that makes creating a DAO as easy as setting up a social media account, and that makes contributing to a DAO as easy as sending an email, with support for all currencies including fiat, ETH, BTC, SOL, USDC, and more.\n\nDAODAO also pioneers fully on-chain social features that can not only increase the role of trust and reputation in the contribution process, but also allow DAOs to go viral in ways that haven't been possible in the past.\n\nBy lowering the barrier to entry for creating a DAO, contributing to a DAO, and engaging socially with a DAO, DAODAO can take DAOs mainstream the same way Coinbase did for tokens and the same way OpenSea did for NFTs.\n\nHowever, unlike Coinbase or OpenSea, which are centralized companies, DAODAO will be run as a DAO itself, called the DAODAO DAO (of course). This will make it so that DAODAO will be a platform that's governed and owned by its users, rather than by elite venture capital firms and hedge funds.\n\n# Team\n\nThe creator of DAODAO is [Nader Al-Naji](https://diamondapp.com/u/nader?feedTab=Hot&tab=posts), head of the [DeSo Foundation](https://deso.org). Across DeSo and Basis, Nader's last project, he has raised hundreds of millions of dollars from thousands of contributors, including Sequoia, Social Capital, and Andreessen Horowitz, and he has built a strong track record for structuring and managing decentralized organizations.\n\nWith DAODAO, Nader and the DeSo Foundation team saw an opportunity to package all of the knowledge they've built up over five years of running decentralized organizations into a product that anyone in the world can use to make their next bold and brilliant idea a reality.\n\n# DAODAO Tokenomics\n\n## Yield\n\nDAODAO as a platform can currently generate fees from two places that can then be paid out to holders of $DAODAO coins as yield:\n* **Fees on its on-chain non-custodial order-book exchange.** Fees are currently zero, but can be increased by a vote of the DAO.\n* **Fees when a DAO closes a round**. Currently, DAODAO collects 1% of all eligible DAO fundraises when the round closes. This amount can be adjusted by a vote of the DAO.\n\nMany other fee sources can be added later on by a vote of existing $DAODAO coin-holders, such as charging for featured DAOs, charging for premium features, and much more. Existing fees can also be adjusted by a vote.\n\nOnce fees accumulate, they will be distributed to holders of $DAODAO coins at regular intervals pro rata according to a scheme that will be voted on by all existing coin-holders. This may include locking $DAODAO coins in order to receive distributions.\n\n## Rounds\n\n$DAODAO coins will be sold via rounds on the DAODAO platform itself. Below is the price schedule for the DAODAO rounds:\n* NFT round: ≈$1.2M\n  - Price per $DAODAO coin was fixed at 0.001 $DESO per $DAODAO coin (≈$0.013 USD)\n* Round 1: $100k USD\n  - **Starting price will be determined by a vote of $DAODAO coin-holders prior to the opening of the round**\n  - Price increases 10% for every ≈$10k USD contributed.\n  - 10% reserve rate\n* After this round, no $DAODAO coins will be minted unless a vote is passed by $DAODAO coin-holders.\n\n## Mirror mirror on the wall, who's the fairest launch of them all?\n\nImportantly, even if Round 1 completely fills, the pre-money valuation of DAODAO is still surprisingly low at ≈$10k USD.\n\nYou read that right— it's not a mistake. We believe very strongly that DAODAO's ownership needs to be decentralized in order for it to succeed, and we're happy to leave the vast majority of the coin supply in the hands of the community as a result.\n",

This will make it so that DAODAO will be a platform that's governed and owned by its users, rather than by elite venture capital firms and hedge funds.\n\n# Team\n\nThe creator of DAODAO is [Nader Al-Naji](https://diamondapp.com/u/nader?feedTab=Hot&tab=posts), head of the [DeSo Foundation](https://deso.org). Across DeSo and Basis, Nader's last project, he has raised hundreds of millions of dollars from thousands of contributors, including Sequoia, Social Capital, and Andreessen Horowitz, and he has built a strong track record for structuring and managing decentralized organizations.\n\nWith DAODAO, Nader and the DeSo Foundation team saw an opportunity to package all of the knowledge they've built up over five years of running decentralized organizations into a product that anyone in the world can use to make their next bold and brilliant idea a reality.\n\n# DAODAO Tokenomics\n\n## Yield\n\nDAODAO as a platform can currently generate fees from two places that can then be paid out to holders of $DAODAO coins as yield:\n* **Fees on its on-chain non-custodial order-book exchange.** Fees are currently zero, but can be increased by a vote of the DAO.\n* **Fees when a DAO closes a round**. Currently, DAODAO collects 1% of all eligible DAO fundraises when the round closes. This amount can be adjusted by a vote of the DAO.\n\nMany other fee sources can be added later on by a vote of existing $DAODAO coin-holders, such as charging for featured DAOs, charging for premium features, and much more. Existing fees can also be adjusted by a vote.\n\nOnce fees accumulate, they will be distributed to holders of $DAODAO coins at regular intervals pro rata according to a scheme that will be voted on by all existing coin-holders. This may include locking $DAODAO coins in order to receive distributions.\n\n## Rounds\n\n$DAODAO coins will be sold via rounds on the DAODAO platform itself. Below is the price schedule for the DAODAO rounds:\n* NFT round: ≈$1.2M\n  - Price per $DAODAO coin was fixed at 0.001 $DESO per $DAODAO coin (≈$0.013 USD)\n* Round 1: $100k USD\n  - **Starting price will be determined by a vote of $DAODAO coin-holders prior to the opening of the round**\n  - Price increases 10% for every ≈$10k USD contributed.\n  - 10% reserve rate\n* After this round, no $DAODAO coins will be minted unless a vote is passed by $DAODAO coin-holders.\n\n## Mirror mirror on the wall, who's the fairest launch of them all?\n\nImportantly, even if Round 1 completely fills, the pre-money valuation of DAODAO is still surprisingly low at ≈$10k USD.\n\nYou read that right— it's not a mistake. We believe very strongly that DAODAO's ownership needs to be decentralized in order for it to succeed, and we're happy to leave the vast majority of the coin supply in the hands of the community as a result.\n",

And we might need that in this bear market. \n\nMid market with a slight bias towards lower is best IMHO.",
